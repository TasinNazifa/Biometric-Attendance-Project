In this Fingerprint Sensor Based Biometric Attendance System using Arduino, we used a Fingerprint Sensor module to authenticate a student or an employee by taking their finger input in the system. Here we are using 4 push buttons to register new fingerprint or delete stored fingerprint or match stored fingerprint. The 4 push buttons are used as an input unit for these tasks. Similarly, RTC Module DS3231 is used for registering scanning/entering/existing time of the user.The LCD displays the time record and every function happening via push button. Buzzer indicates different functions and happening whenever an interrupt is detected. The LED is used for power indication.

This biometric attendance system is used to enhance the attendance monitoring system of institutions, improve efficient and save time.
